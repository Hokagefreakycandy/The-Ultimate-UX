# The-Ultimate-UX
Reviving the UX database for improvement!
I've been home for a while, and I have to train my brain to think like a researcher again. 
What's better than writing a book:)

### What is UX anyway?
User experience is an interdisciplinary field of sociology, psychology, and design. It is about how users interact with the product and how we communicate information effectively.
As fague as it might sound, YES, it is fague! And that's what we do: we want to narrow down the abstract, turn our insights into tangible requirements. It is very annoying because 
it is not only design nor research, or computer science. You have to know a bit of everything!
